This was my first ever basic project 
To put it in just one single statement, the main goal here was to create a “guess the word” game. key things you need to note. 

    -The user needs to be able to input letter guesses.
    -A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use.
    -Keep notifying the user of the remaining turns.

Words are grabbed from seperate test file

There are functions to check if the user has actually inputted a single letter, to check if the inputted letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable to limit guesses
